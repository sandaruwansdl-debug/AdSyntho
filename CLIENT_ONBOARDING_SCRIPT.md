### Opening
"Thank you for your interest in Ad Syntho. We've built an AI-powered platform that unifies all your ad accounts and provides actionable insights to optimize your campaigns. Let me show you how it works."

### Dashboard Demo
"Here's your unified dashboard. Instead of logging into Facebook, Google Ads, and TikTok separately, you see everything in one place. These KPI cards show your total spend, revenue, ROAS, and active campaigns across all platforms."

### AI Insights Demo
"This is where Ad Syntho really shines. Our AI analyzes your campaign data and provides specific recommendations. For example, it detected that your Facebook campaign CTR dropped 15% and suggests refreshing ad creatives. It also identified that your Google Ads campaign is performing 25% above average and recommends increasing the budget."

### Account Connection Demo
"Connecting your accounts is simple and secure. You click 'Connect Facebook,' authorize the connection, and we automatically sync all your campaign data. The same process works for Google Ads, TikTok, and other platforms."

### Cross-Platform Analysis
"Here's the real value - cross-platform insights. You can see that TikTok is your best-performing platform with a 2.8x ROAS, while Facebook is at 2.1x. Our AI suggests reallocating 20% of your Facebook budget to TikTok for better returns."
